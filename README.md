# Encrypt-Decrypt-Website
This system is developed using python(flask), Pycrypto, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
The purpose of this project is to secure text/file transfer and to evaluate whether 
data transfer with the implementation of AES is intact and secure. 
The project will use AES for encryption and decryption of the text/file transfer because AES is capable of 
solving problem that cannot be solved by other algorithm such as DES, Triple-DES and  RSA in protecting information.
